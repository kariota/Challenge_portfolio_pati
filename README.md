# Task 1 - Software configuration
Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?

I currently work in IT (Service desk), and I already completed QA Manual courses. I'd like to gain knowledge in Automation testing. 
My goal is to get an experience in QA environment and become a professional software tester.
I hope this project will give me some basic knowledge in QA Automation sphere, and I hope to receive some practical experience as well. 
Thank you all for this great opportunity!
